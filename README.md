The issues in the To-Do List application stemmed primarily from timing and missing function calls. The first and third bugs, where tasks were either not visible after adding or disappeared on page refresh, were both caused by the asynchronous behavior of the loadTasks() function. It used a setTimeout() to populate the tasks array from localStorage, but renderTasks() was being called before the tasks were actually loaded, resulting in an empty task list despite the counter showing the correct number. This was resolved by moving the renderTasks() and updateTaskCount() calls inside the setTimeout() block to ensure they only execute after tasks are fully loaded. The second bug, where the filter buttons (All, Active, Completed) did not work, was due to the fact that although the selected filter was updated and styling changed, the task list was never re-rendered to reflect the selected filter. This was fixed by calling renderTasks() at the end of the setFilter() function to update the visible tasks based on the selected filter.
